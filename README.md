Documentation Ideas Around TypeScript and Rollup (research)


## Exploring
- typescript-rollup-resolve a resolver inside typescript that uses rollup and adds the result to the programm
- rollup-typescript rollup injects its result into the typescript programm programatical.
- TypeScript and rollup share a Ast Model it would be great if rollup would use the same ast as typescript.

## Profit?

the typescript language server runs inside the IDE and there we produce our code while we will at the end
probally bundle the code to distribute it we will not want to do that on development while still make sure
that our result can be build so it is a natural fit to put them both together.
